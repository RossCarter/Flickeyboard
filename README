About Flickeyboard.

Flickeyboard is a replacement for the standard iOS keyboard. The resons for developing Flickeyboard, and its basic operation, are set out in http://rosscarter.com/2010/320.html

This project includes a sample app that shows how to use a Flickeyboard with a standard UITextView.

To do: 

Cursor and select positions should be swapped (to avoid outward flicks on edge keys).

Selections are not drawn.

Need graphics for cmd, backspace, return, hide. Select key needs blue selection points instead of "select". 

Cut, copy, paste don't work.

Key gradients differ from standard keyboard.

Visual and audio feedback on taps; swipes should show gradient, maybe. 

Limit max distance for a swipe. 

Add one-hand layout, portrait.

Implement Caps Lock: two-finger downward swipe toggles mode; keys are redrawn with upper and lower case glyphs swapped. (This allows typing the occasional lowercase character while in Caps Lock mode.)

Tap and Hold on a key could trigger a menu of diacritical marks to add to the character.
